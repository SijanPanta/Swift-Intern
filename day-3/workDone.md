# Day 3 – Internship Learning Journal

## 1. Learning and Practicing API Testing with Postman

Today, I learned how to use **Postman** as an API development and testing tool. I explored how Postman helps backend developers interact with APIs without relying on a frontend interface.

**Key concepts covered:**

* Understanding HTTP methods such as `GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, and `DELETE`
* Sending requests with query parameters, request headers, and JSON request bodies
* Interpreting HTTP status codes and server responses
* Testing REST APIs by validating returned data and response structure

This helped me understand how backend APIs are consumed and tested in real-world development workflows.

## 2. Debugger Mode in Visual Studio Code

I learned how to use **debugger mode in VS Code** to inspect and troubleshoot JavaScript code more effectively.

**Key learnings:**

* Setting breakpoints to pause code execution at specific lines
* Stepping through code using step over, step into, and step out
* Inspecting variable values and the call stack during runtime
* Understanding execution flow and identifying logical errors

This practice improved my ability to debug complex logic instead of relying solely on `console.log()` statements.

## 3. Solving JavaScript Problems on LeetCode

I practiced solving **JavaScript coding problems on LeetCode**, focusing on improving problem-solving skills and logical thinking.

**Concepts reinforced through practice:**

* Array operations such as iteration, filtering, and transformation
* Conditional logic and edge-case handling
* Awareness of time and space complexity
* Writing clean, readable, and optimized JavaScript code

Solving these problems strengthened my understanding of JavaScript fundamentals, which are essential for backend development.
